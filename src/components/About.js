                                    Hi, I'm Tung, but also go by Louis. I'm a
                                    junior at Denion University I'm pursuing a
                                    BS degree in computer science and
                                    mathematics with an expected graduation in
                                    2024. What I'm most passionate about are
                                    cultivating technical solutions to
                                    real-world problems, advocating
                                    sustainability, and building
                                    community-driven applications.

                                    appreciate every challenge I came across
                                    that helped cultivate my self-efficacy in
                                    this risk-taking world. Through internships
                                    at innovative tech companies, I learned the
                                    importance of staying open-minded to
                                    changes, whether they be adaptations to new
                                    project alignments, programming languages,
                                    or attitudes. I feel highly motivated as I
                                    discover ways to improve flexibility and
                                    creativity through ongoing discussions with
                                    others to address a customerâ€™s changing
                                    needs.

                                    <span className="free-time">ðŸ‘Ÿ </span>I love
                                    to organize my room on a regular basis. Such
                                    habit transfers to my every aspect of life.
                                    I always try to start the day with a
                                    goal-oriented mindset and bring my organized
                                    characteristics to the work I do for maximum
                                    productivity. Rather than following rigid
                                    approaches, I prefer to strive to expand my
                                    comfort zone and adopt unconventional
                                    methods to build sustainable solutions.

                                    What compels me to wake up for work and
                                    become fully charged for the day is knowing
                                    I have another chance to bring warmth and
                                    friendship to my community. I thrive in jobs
                                    that foster diversity and culture, enjoying
                                    collaborations with people from different
                                    walks of life for a shared mission. Not only
                                    do I see it as a chance to accumulate new
                                    knowledge, but also to deeply connect with
                                    others through their different views at
                                    problems. I aim to be a team player, be in
                                    tune with the emotional needs of those
                                    around me, and thrive on positive
                                    reinforcement.
