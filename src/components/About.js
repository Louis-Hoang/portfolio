                                    Hi, I'm Tung, but you can call me Louis. I'm
                                    a junior at Denion University I'm pursuing a
                                    BS degree in computer science and
                                    mathematics with an expected graduation in
                                    2024. What I'm most passionate about are
                                    cultivating technical solutions to
                                    real-world problems, advocating
                                    sustainability to support my surrounding
                                    communities.

                                    appreciate every challenge I came across
                                    that helped building my self-efficacy in
                                    this ever-changing world. Through
                                    internships at innovative tech companies, I
                                    learned the importance of embracing new
                                    changes, whether they be adaptations to new
                                    working paradigm, programming languages, or
                                    attitudes. I am thrilled when I am given the
                                    chance to discover ways to improve
                                    flexibility and creativity through ongoing
                                    discussions with others to address
                                    customers' changing needs.

                                    Besides work and school, I love running and
                                    working out. Such habit not only help me
                                    staying healthy but it also allow me to push
                                    myself forward everyday which will energized
                                    me for my day. Also, while doing these
                                    activity I usually find unconventional
                                    answers for blockroads that I am facing
                                    since I can let my mind freely wander
                                    without distraction.

                                    What inspires me to push myself forward
                                    everyday is knowing that I have another
                                    chance to make a difference and better
                                    people's day through good deeds. I thrive in
                                    jobs that foster diversity and culture,
                                    enjoying collaborations with people from
                                    different backgrounds for a mutual goal. Not
                                    only do I see it as a chance to gain new
                                    experience, but also to deeply connect with
                                    others through their different perspectives.
                                    I strive to be a team player, be in tune
                                    with the emotional needs of those around me.
